# Text-Summariser
This project is a **Text Summarizer** that uses Hugging Face's `distilbart-cnn-12-6` model and Gradio for a simple web interface. It allows users to input text and receive a concise summary. The model efficiently condenses lengthy content, providing key insights in a shorter format for easier understanding.
